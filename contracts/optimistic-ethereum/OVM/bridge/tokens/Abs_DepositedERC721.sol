 * @title Abs_DepositedERC721

 * Usually contract mints new tokens when it hears about deposits from the other side.
 * This contract also burns the tokens intended for withdrawal, informing the gateway to release the funds.
 *
 * NOTE: This abstract contract gives all the core functionality of a deposited token implementation except for the
 * token's internal accounting itself.  This gives developers an easy way to implement children with their own token code.
